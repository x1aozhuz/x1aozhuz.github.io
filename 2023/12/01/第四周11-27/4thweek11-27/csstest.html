            <h1>  Hello World</h1>
            <p>
                Amidst all the chaos, a mother was talking to her child, just talking. This woman, in her thirties, 
                looks inconspicuous in any other way. Staring at her daughter's face, 
                she looks like she's already four years old. 
                The child listened carefully and realized the importance of his mother's words. 
                The mother's gaze was fixed firmly on the child, 
                as if she was not influenced by the voices of sadness and fear around her.

                A picture flashed into my mind of another little girl who had recently survived a terrible plane crash. 
                It was reported that she had lived because her mother had strapped her own body over the little girls in order to protect her. 
                The mother did not survive. The newspapers had been tracking how the little girl had been treated by psychologists 
                for weeks afterward to ward off feelings of guilt and unworthiness that often haunt survivors. 
                The child was told over and over again that it had not been her fault that her mommy had gone away.
                 I hoped this situation would not end the same way.
